# Testing Bot Repo OpenClaw

A simple HTML project created and managed by Nuel the Cat Bot using OpenClaw and GitHub CLI! 🐱

## 🚀 What is this?

This is a test repository to demonstrate OpenClaw's integration with GitHub CLI (gh). All operations (repo creation, file creation, commits, pushes, issues, labels) are performed programmatically through the bot.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **GitHub CLI Integration**: Fully automated GitHub operations
- ✅ **Responsive HTML Page**: Beautiful gradient design with animations
- ✅ **Automated Workflows**: Commit, push, issue creation via CLI
- ✅ **Custom Labels**: Testing labels for issue categorization

## 📁 Project Structure

```
testing-bot-repo-openclaw/
├── index.html          # Main HTML page with gradient design
├── .gitignore         # Gitignore for HTML projects
└── README.md          # This file
```

## 🎨 Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with gradients, animations, and responsive design
- **No JavaScript**: Pure HTML/CSS (keeping it simple!)

## 🔧 How It Was Created

All of this was created through OpenClaw bot + GitHub CLI:

1. **Repository Creation**
   ```bash
   gh repo create testing-bot-repo-openclaw --public --add-readme --license=mit
   ```

2. **File Creation & Git Operations**
   - Created `index.html` with gradient design
   - Added `.gitignore` for HTML projects
   - Committed and pushed via Git

3. **Issue Management**
   - Created test issue #1
   - Added custom labels (testing, etc.)
   - Managed issue lifecycle
